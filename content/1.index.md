# THE SOLUTION ARCHITECT MANIFESTO

<div style="text-align: justify;">

### A <span style="color:red"> solution architect </span> creates the overall technical vision for a specific solution to a business problem.

<br>

This manifesto is a statement of beliefs that are deemed indispensable in order to be a successful solution architect in the field of data and analytics. The initial version of this manifesto was created by [Glenn Vanderlinden](https://www.linkedin.com/in/glennvanderlinden/), co-founder at [Human37](https://human37.com). It is based on ~10 years of being a solution architect in consultancies and is heavily influenced by working with some of the most brilliant solution architects from leading analytics companies and vendors.

None of the following should be considered as the truth but merely as a set of beliefs that act as a reference point for solution architects, current and aspiring. The order of these beliefs is of no particular order.

The objective of this manifesto is to become a reference in the industry. Therefore <u>contributions are encouraged and appreciated. Contributing to the solution architect manifesto is possible via [:icon{name="prime:github"}](https://www.linkedin.com/in/glennvanderlinden/)</u>.

## <span style="color:red"> The manifesto </span>

### Assume a client’s briefing is incomplete

<br>
Clients will share the problem from their perspective or role. This means that the briefing you receive is more often than not incomplete. Do not assume that the problem that is presented is the actual problem to be solved. Be aware of this and explore additional perspectives. Never assume, always validate.

### Scope the problem, then work it

<br>
In order to provide the correct solution for a problem the problem must be scoped precisely.
Kidlin’s law

```md
“If you write the problem down clearly, then the matter is half solved”.
```

To do so, be relentless on the details and the use of words. Words make up our perception of reality therefore it is important to be precise. Once the scope has been defined clearly and precisely you can start to “work the problem”.

Working the problem is a concept brought to my attention by Chris Hadfield in his book “An astronaut’s guide to life on earth”

```md
“Working the problem” is NASA-speak for descending one decision
tree after another, methodically looking for a solution until you
run out of oxygen”.
```

### Meetings are for working the problem

<br>
Meetings are part of working the problem. It is a misconception that the purpose of a client meeting is to brief or simply share an overview of the current state of the project and that the actual work happens outside of it in isolation. Consider every meeting, including the first, an opportunity to get closer to the solution you seek. Problem solving happens with the client as he/she (unknowingly) holds most, if not all, of the info required to obtain a deep understanding of the problem and, as a result, the required solution. Progress should be booked after every meeting – this can take the form of having a better understanding of the problem, the discovery of new paths to explore or paths being crossed off.

### Always be exploring, always be testing

<br>
A solution architect stops being a solution architect when he/she seizes to explore. The pace of change is high in our world and we need to keep up. Therefore you can not be afraid of exploring things independently. You are the vanguard that goes in first to discover the unknown.

Both discovery and validation happen in a sanbox. So make sure you have one sandbox. Don’t provide client advice based on a hypothesis or something you merely read. Don’t be solely dependent on vendor support. “Did you test it?” is a rhetorical question you should ask yourself every time a recommendation is made or a solution shipped.

### Answers ≠ solutions

<br>
You can provide answers without solving the problem. You will encounter this often when engaging with vendor support, however it is a mistake many solution architects are guilty of making.

Example — You made an assumption and tried to solve a particular problem in a certain way. However, this approach failed or you got stuck and logged a support ticket as a result. Support might tell you it is not possible because this is not how this report or feature works. They might go to great lengths to inform you how that particular feature or report can be used but do not provide an way to actually solve what you were looking for. In this example the support service has has answered your question, but the problem remains unsolved.

While answers are a response to a question. Solutions are a response to a problem. Don’t make the mistake of assuming your job is done by providing an answer. If the path towards a solution is blocked, don’t take no for an answer but provide an alternative solution.

### Ticket immediately

<br>

### Document or perish
