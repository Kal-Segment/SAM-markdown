# THE SOLUTION ARCHITECT MANIFESTO

<div style="text-align: justify;">

## A <span style="color:red"> solution architect </span> creates the overall technical vision for a specific solution to a business problem.

<br>

This manifesto is a statement of beliefs that are deemed indispensable in order to be a successful solution architect in the field of data and analytics. The initial version of this manifesto was created by [Glenn Vanderlinden](https://www.linkedin.com/in/glennvanderlinden/){:target="\_blank"}, co-founder at [Human37](https://human37.com){:target="\_blank"}. It is based on ~10 years of being a solution architect in consultancies and is heavily influenced by working with some of the most brilliant solution architects from leading analytics companies and vendors.

None of the following should be considered as the truth but merely as a set of beliefs that act as a reference point for solution architects, current and aspiring. The order of these beliefs is of no particular order.

The objective of this manifesto is to become a reference in the industry. Therefore **contributions are encouraged and appreciated**. Contributing to the solution architect manifesto is possible via [:icon{name="prime:github"}](https://github.com/glnv/SAM-markdown).

## <span style="color:red"> The manifesto </span>

### 1. Assume a client’s briefing is incomplete

Clients will share the problem from their perspective or role. This means that the briefing you receive is more often than not incomplete. _**Do not assume that the problem that is presented is the actual problem to be solved**_. Be aware of this and explore additional perspectives. Never assume, always validate.
<br>

### 2. Scope the problem, then work it

In order to provide the correct solution for a problem the problem must be scoped precisely.
Kidlin’s law

```md
“If you write the problem down clearly, then the matter is half solved”.
```

To do so, be relentless on the details and the use of words. Words make up our perception of reality therefore it is important to be precise. Once the scope has been defined clearly and precisely you can start to “work the problem”.

Working the problem is a concept brought to my attention by Chris Hadfield in his book “An astronaut’s guide to life on earth”

```md
“Working the problem” is NASA-speak for descending one decision
tree after another, methodically looking for a solution until you
run out of oxygen”.
```

### 3. Meetings are for working the problem

Meetings are part of working the problem. It is a misconception that the purpose of a client meeting is to brief or simply share an overview of the current state of the project and that the actual work happens outside of it in isolation. Consider every meeting, including the first, an opportunity to get closer to the solution you seek. Problem solving happens with the client as he/she (unknowingly) holds most, if not all, of the info required to obtain a deep understanding of the problem and, as a result, the required solution. _**Progress should be booked after every meeting**_. This can take the form of having a better understanding of the problem, the discovery of new paths to explore or paths being crossed off.
<br>

### 4. Always be exploring, always be testing

A solution architect stops being a solution architect when he/she seizes to explore. You must be comfortable to discover the unknown. _**Solution architects are not necessarily hired to "know", they are hired to find out**_. We live for the search and clients hire us to end theirs.

Make sure you have a sandbox. It is a laboratory where both exploration and validation happen. Don’t provide client advice purely based on a hypothesis or non-validate documentation. “Did you test it?” is a rhetorical question you should ask yourself every time a recommendation is made or a solution shipped.
<br>

### 5. Answers ≠ solutions

You can provide answers without solving the problem. You will encounter this often when engaging with vendor support.
Unfortunately it is a mistake many solution architects are guilty of making.

Example — You tried to solve a business question using a specific report in an analytics platform. However, this approach failed and you logged a support ticket as a result. Support might tell you that what you are trying to achieve is not possible with this report as the report does not function in this way. Support then elaborates on the constraints of the report and the inner workings. In this example the support service has has answered your question, but the problem remains unsolved.

_**While answers are a response to a question. Solutions are a response to a problem**_. Don’t make the mistake of assuming your job is done by providing an answer. If the path towards a solution is blocked, don’t take no for an answer but provide an alternative solution.
<br>

### 6. Ticket immediately

Ticket immediately in cases where additional support is required internally/externally. Internal/external resources often rely on service level agreements (SLAs) that require them to resolve a first response to a ticket within a specific timeframe (e.g: 24 hours). Every hour you wait to log a ticket gets added to that timeline and thus to you receiving your response. Logging a ticket at 10h00 ensures you have a first response before 10h00 the next day. However, waiting an additional 6 hours before logging (logging at 16h00) means that the response is potentially delayed by 6 hours as well (max timeline to breach SLA from external support is 16h00 the next day in this example). Not only will this ensure that the solution is reached faster, it also means it reduces the potential risk of breaking your SLA versus the client. Therefore _**ticket immediately when depending on external resources**_.
<br>

### 7. Document or perish

Always provide minimum viable documentation. Documentation ensures consistency when operating the solution as well as knowledge transfer when team composition changes. _**Solutions are not final as long as they have not been documented**_. The act of documenting is more important than the form it takes.
<br>

### 8. Think in mental modules

Solutions are composed of a combination of different components. So are the tools that provide the environment in which the solution needs to be designed. _**As a solution architect you need to be able to think beyond the intial/obvious purpose of each of these features but rather understand the core functionality of each of them**_. This turns them into modules that can be reused as part of your solution in an alternative context.

Examples are

- the usage of b2b features to analyse travel parties for hotels or airline brands.
- the usage of ecommerce checkout behavior in the context of SaaS subscriptions.

As you gain more experience you will be able to apply this at a technology-agnostic level and deconstruct entire solutions into modules.
